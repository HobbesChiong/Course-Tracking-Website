# Course-Tracking-Website

Course Tracking Website lets users plan their future academic schedules by seeing previous and future SFU course offerings. The project was implemented with the Model-View-Controller design pattern in mind. The course data is given through a CSV file and parsed into the model built in Java. The API made with Java and Spring Boot lets the front end made with HTML, CSS and JS, retrieve and edit the course data as it needs to.
